# EFYDA
### Python 3.0!
### To launch the program, run - asist.py
### The Pich.py file is needed to edit the voil altitude (like a tank anime)
### The program creates and rewrites the following files:
### Sound.wav
### 4_b_octave_up.wav
### Sound.wav records the data of the desired phrase and, accordingly, play from it
### 4_b_octave_up.wav, a changed voice is recorded by 4 (in any case, it should be!) Oktava is responsible for this - the parameters -
### Manipulation = Call (SND, "To Manipulation", 0.01, 75, 600) This
###     Pitch_Tier = Call (Manipulation, "Extract Pitch Tier")
###     Call (Pitch_Tier, "Multiply Frequencies", SND.xmin, SND.xmax, 2.07) and this
### For custom voices, it is necessary to install in Windows in the register at the address:
### HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Speech\Voices\Tokens
